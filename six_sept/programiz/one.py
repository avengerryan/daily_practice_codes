# Illustrate different set operations


# define 2 set variables and let us perform set operations: union, intersection, differnece and symmetric difference

# Python offers a datatype called set, whose elements must ne unique.


# define three sets
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


# set union
print('Union of E and N is', E | N)

# set intersection
print('Intersection of E and N is', E & N)

# set difference
print('Difference of E and N is', E - N)

# set symmetric difference
print('Symmetric difference of E and N is', E ^ N)
